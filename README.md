## Game Info

 - Players are two cute box animals. Each Player attempt to sit on other
   player head.
   
- They are helped by powerups like 2X Boosters and Bullet shots. 
   
 - Laser and Bombs are also threats to our players. 

 - And did I mentioned the thorn to avoid at top and hostile speed of platforms increase after every half-minute?

## Control

I should have provided this control info inside the game. but... here it is.

Player1 :
 *W* - Jump;
 *A* - Move Left;
 *D* -Move Right;
 *E* - To shoot a bullet in the direction you were last moving;

Player2 :
 *ArrowUp* - Jump;
 *ArrowLeft* - Move Left;
 *ArrowRight* -Move Right;
 *Right CTRL* - To shoot a bullet in the direction you were last moving;

## Motivation

This is my first game.

I was trying to create a platform jumping box game but wanted to do something new.

So Inspired by thumb fight, made it into a fighting arena and like thumb fight, one player tries to press another below him.
 
Later added Laser, Bombs, and Powerup for more Fun, and these are served over upward-moving platforms.
